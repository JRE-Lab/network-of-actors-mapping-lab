# Network of Actors Mapping Lab

This repository contains materials for a network-of-actors mapping lab. The lab guides you through building an actor map for a topic like sanctions evasion networks, ransomware affiliate ecosystems or militia financing.

## Overview

You will:
- Select a topic and define the scope of the actor network.
- Collect data from open sources such as corporate registries, sanctions lists, court filings and journalism.
- Perform entity resolution to merge references to the same actors across sources.
- Create a link chart using network analysis tools (e.g. networkx or Gephi) to visualise relationships and influence.
- Distinguish between known facts and analytical assessments, and document assumptions.
- Produce an entity dictionary, link chart and narrative assessment summarising the network.

All data used in this lab comes from publicly available sources and is used for research and educational purposes only.
